# TaskManager
Inspiration:
Currently, we are facing a worldwide pandemic. All of our classes and activities have gone completely online. I found it difficult to manage all the tasks. Time management is extremely crucial. So, I wanted to build something that would help me manage all my classes and tasks accordingly.

What it does :
The App helps you add in all the tasks that you have for the particular day. It helps you manage all your work efficiently.

How:
I built it The App was completely built on Android Studio. I used Java to code the App.

Challenges I ran into:
We wanted to add in a function that would give up pop sound notification and provide remainders for the online class schedules. But due to some errors and the restricted time frame we couldn't succeed.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of :
This is my first Android App and I'm proud that I could build something from scratch.

What I learned:
I learned that if you put in the required hard work and if you have the determination, you can accomplish anything.

What's next for Task Manager:
We want to add more options for the App that would remind you about deadlines for fee payments, the due date of Netflix subscriptions, etc. We also want to add the option of providing online class links as notifications to remind us about the class schedule and help us attend all classes efficiently.
